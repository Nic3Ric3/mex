# Decisions

<!-- HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
     Each decision follows the format below.
     When a decision changes: DO NOT delete the old entry.
     Mark it as superseded, add the new entry above it.
     The history must be preserved — this is the event clock. -->

## Decision Log

<!-- Document key decisions using the format below.
     Include decisions that: are non-obvious, have important constraints,
     or where the reasoning prevents future mistakes.
     Do not document every decision — only ones where "why" matters.

     Format for each entry:

     ### [Decision Title]
     **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
     **Status:** Active | Superseded by [title]
     **Decision:** [What was decided, in one sentence]
     **Reasoning:** [Why this was chosen]
     **Alternatives considered:** [What else was considered and why it was rejected]
     **Consequences:** [What this means for the codebase going forward]

     Example:

     ### Use PostgreSQL for all persistent storage
     **Date:** 2024-03-01
     **Status:** Active
     **Decision:** All persistent data lives in PostgreSQL, no secondary databases.
     **Reasoning:** Simplicity — one database to operate, backup, and reason about.
     **Alternatives considered:** Redis for sessions (rejected — adds operational complexity for minimal gain), MongoDB for user preferences (rejected — relational model fits our data).
     **Consequences:** No caching layer at database level. Application-level caching if needed. -->
