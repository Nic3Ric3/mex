- New conventions have been established
- The scaffold feels out of date

## Resync Prompt

Paste the following prompt into your agent:

**SYNC PROMPT — copy everything between the lines:**

```
You are going to resync the AI context scaffold for this project.
The scaffold may be out of date — the codebase has changed since it was last populated.

First, read all files in context/ to understand the current scaffold state.
Then explore what has changed in the codebase since the scaffold was last updated.
Check the last_updated dates in the YAML frontmatter of each file.

For each context/ file:
1. Compare the current scaffold content to the actual codebase
2. Identify what has changed, been added, or been removed
3. Update the file to reflect the current state

Critical rules for updating:
- In context/decisions.md: NEVER delete existing decisions.
  If a decision has changed, mark the old entry as "Superseded by [new decision title]"
  and add the new decision above it with today's date.
- In all other files: update content to reflect current reality
- Update last_updated in the YAML frontmatter of every file you change
- After updating each file, update ROUTER.md Current Project State

When done, report:
- Which files were updated and what changed
- Any decisions that were superseded
- Any slots that could not be filled with confidence
```
