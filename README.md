AI agents forget everything between sessions. mex gives them permanent, navigable project memory.

Every session starts cold:

- The agent has **no idea** what it built yesterday
- It forgets the conventions you agreed on
- It doesn't know what broke last week

Developers compensate by stuffing everything into CLAUDE.md — but that floods the context window, burns tokens, and degrades attention. Meanwhile, the project changes and nobody updates the docs. The agent's understanding drifts from reality.

mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a CLI that keeps it honest. The scaffold gives agents persistent project knowledge through navigable files — architecture, conventions, decisions, patterns. The CLI detects when those files drift from the actual codebase, and targets AI to fix only what's broken. The scaffold grows automatically — after every task, the agent updates project state and creates patterns from real work.

Works with any stack — JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, and more.

## Star History

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=theDakshJaitly/mex&type=Timeline)](https://star-history.com/#theDakshJaitly/mex&Timeline)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theDakshJaitly/mex.git .mex
bash .mex/setup.sh
```

The setup script auto-builds the CLI, pre-scans your codebase, and runs a targeted prompt to populate the scaffold. Takes about 5 minutes.

> **Using `mex` shorthand:** Commands below use `mex` — run `cd .mex && npm link && cd ..` once to enable this. Or replace `mex` with `node .mex/dist/cli.js` if you prefer not to link globally.

## Drift Detection

Eight checkers validate your scaffold against the real codebase. Zero tokens, zero AI.

| Checker | What it catches |
|---------|----------------|
| **path** | Referenced file paths that don't exist on disk |
| **edges** | YAML frontmatter edge targets pointing to missing files |
| **index-sync** | `patterns/INDEX.md` out of sync with actual pattern files |
| **staleness** | Scaffold files not updated in 30+ days or 50+ commits |
| **command** | `npm run X` / `make X` referencing scripts that don't exist |
| **dependency** | Claimed dependencies missing from `package.json` |
| **cross-file** | Same dependency with different versions across files |
| **script-coverage** | `package.json` scripts not mentioned in any scaffold file |

Scoring: starts at 100. Deducts -10 per error, -3 per warning, -1 per info.

## CLI

The CLI is built automatically during `setup.sh`. All commands run from your **project root** (not from inside `.mex/`).

```bash
mex check
```

If you need to rebuild manually:

```bash
cd .mex && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `mex check` | Run all 8 checkers, output drift score and issues |
| `mex check --quiet` | One-liner: `mex: drift score 92/100 (1 warning)` |
| `mex check --json` | Full report as JSON for programmatic use |
| `mex check --fix` | Check and jump straight to sync if errors found |
| `mex sync` | Detect drift → choose mode → AI fixes → verify → repeat |
| `mex sync --dry-run` | Preview targeted prompts without executing |
| `mex sync --warnings` | Include warning-only files in sync |
| `mex init` | Pre-scan codebase, build structured brief for AI |
| `mex init --json` | Raw scanner brief as JSON |
| `mex watch` | Install post-commit hook (silent on perfect score) |
| `mex watch --uninstall` | Remove the hook |
| `mex commands` | List all commands and scripts with descriptions |

### Shell Scripts

The shell scripts are **bash scripts** and require a bash-compatible shell. On macOS and Linux they work out of the box. On Windows, use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), or any bash-compatible terminal.

These run from your project root. They auto-build the CLI if needed. All support `--help`.

```bash
bash .mex/setup.sh       # First-time setup — scan, prompt, populate
bash .mex/sync.sh        # Interactive menu — check, sync, or export prompt
bash .mex/update.sh      # Pull latest mex infrastructure, keep your content
```

> **Note:** The CLI commands (`node .mex/dist/cli.js ...`) work on any platform with Node.js, including Windows cmd and PowerShell. Only the shell scripts above require bash.

## Before / After

Real output from testing mex on Agrow, an AI-powered agricultural voice helpline (Python/Flask, Twilio, multi-provider pipeline).

**Scaffold before setup:**
```markdown
## Current Project State
<!-- What is working. What is not yet built. Known issues.
     Update this section whenever significant work is completed. -->
```

**Scaffold after setup:**
```markdown
## Current Project State

**Working:**
- Voice call pipeline (Twilio → STT → LLM → TTS → response)
- Multi-provider STT (ElevenLabs, Deepgram) with configurable selection
- RAG system with Supabase pgvector for agricultural knowledge retrieval
- Streaming pipeline with barge-in support

**Not yet built:**
- Admin dashboard for call monitoring
- Automated test suite
- Multi-turn conversation memory across calls

**Known issues:**
- Sarvam AI STT bypass active — routing to ElevenLabs as fallback
```

**Patterns directory after setup:**
```
patterns/
├── add-api-client.md       # Steps, gotchas, verify checklist for new service clients
├── add-language-support.md  # How to extend the 8-language voice pipeline
├── debug-pipeline.md        # Where to look when a call fails at each stage
└── add-rag-documents.md     # How to ingest new agricultural knowledge
```

## Real World Results

Independently tested by a community member on **OpenClaw** across 10 structured scenarios on a homelab setup (Ubuntu 24.04, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, networking, monitoring). 10/10 tests passed. Drift score: 100/100.

**Token usage before vs after mex:**

| Scenario | Without mex | With mex | Saved |
|----------|------------|---------|-------|
| "How does K8s work?" | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,450 tokens | 56% |
| "Open UFW port" | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,050 tokens | 68% |
| "Explain Docker" | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,100 tokens | 67% |
| Multi-context query | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,650 tokens | 50% |

**~60% average token reduction per session.**

Context is no longer all-or-nothing — loaded on demand, only what's relevant.

## How It Works

```
Session starts
    ↓
Agent loads CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded, lives at project root)
    ↓
CLAUDE.md says "Read .mex/ROUTER.md before doing anything"
    ↓
ROUTER.md routing table → loads relevant context file for this task
    ↓
context file → points to pattern file if task-specific guidance exists
    ↓
Agent executes with full project context, minimal token cost
    ↓
After task: agent updates scaffold (GROW step)
    ↓
New patterns, updated project state — scaffold grows from real work
```

CLAUDE.md stays at ~120 tokens. The agent navigates to only what it needs. After every task, the agent updates the scaffold — creating patterns from new task types, updating project state, fixing stale context. The scaffold compounds over time.

## Multi-Tool Compatibility

| Tool | Config file |
|------|------------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` |
| GitHub Copilot | `copilot-instructions.md` |

All config files contain identical content. `setup.sh` asks which tool you use and copies the right one.
